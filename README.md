# The Project

We are three students soon-to-be system and embeded engineers.
PleePlee is a small gardener robot we are building for our master's project.

## Interface

This repository is about the graphical interface used to initialise and
configure the robot. This interface can also be used as a simulator.
The user fist has to initialize the map. Then after the setup phase of the
robot, it is used to correct mistakes and clarify the map. For example
the robot only recognize an obstacle, it will be the user job through this
interfaceto dissociate between plants and real obstacles.
